# [ADR_006](../../README.md) Sharding & Routing per Geographic Region

Date: 11/1

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When trying to build a robust and highly available system, it is important to consider how to manage users from different regions. Sharding users to different deployments of a service based on their geographic location gives some natural load balancing, and ensures that users are not heavily impacted by latency to distant servers.

## Decision

We have chosen to have a singular deployment of the farmacy food system.

Farmacyfood's goals at this time are to operate and expand within a single city in the near term. This does not justify the complication of managing multiple different deployments in one or more datacenters,  or dealing with sharding users across infrastructure.

## Consequences

Should farmacyfood expand to multiple cities across the united states, the nature of viewing/ordering meals and receiving recommendations will likely not be heavily impacted by higher latency operations due to geographic distance.

Business wise, it would be a very great problem for farmacyfoods to have if a singular deployment is not scaling well enough. That bridge can be crossed later.
