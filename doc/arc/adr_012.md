# [ADR_012](../../README.md) Use mobile friendly web application

Date: 10/29

## Status

accepted

## Context

We discussed the form of front end for the initial design and implementation. We were debating over using native app vs using mobile friendly web app.

### Option 1: **Native app**
#### Pros
+ Smoother user experience
+ Capable of location based service based on GPS information
+ Capable of Push notification 

#### Cons
+ Have to support multiple platforms, longer developing time and higher cost
+ Require user to update the app in case there is an upgrade

### Option 2: **Mobile friendly web app**
#### Pros
+ Lower cost to develop, and shorter development time, available for all users. 
+ Easier deployment and upgrade 

#### Cons
+ Can not obtain precise location information
+ Can not do push notification


## Decision
We have chosen mobile friendly web app, mostly because of cost efficiency and faster deployment, which are crucial in the initial stage. Farmacy Food can always develop native app later if needed.

## Consequences
Web app does not support push notification and does not provide reliable location based information.
