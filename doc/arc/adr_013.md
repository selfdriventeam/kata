# [ADR_013](../../README.md)  Use REST between Customer, Order and Pricing

Date: 10/30

## Status

accepted

## Context

We discussed what should be the communication method between Customer and Order, Order and Pricing. This ADR records the reasoning behind the decision.

### Option 1: **REST**
#### Pros
* Service is capable of providing results.

#### Cons
* Tight coupling between services

### Option 2: **Messaging/Event Based**
#### Pros
+ Loose coupling 
+ Non-blocking on the client side. 
+ Easy to scale

#### Cons
+ Service loose the ability to send response back to the client in case there is a failure. 

## Decision
We have chosen REST. Because client would expect Pricing and Order service to response in case there is an error. 

## Consequences
Service has to be reliable and highly available. In case of service is down, or not available, client will need to proper handle the error.
