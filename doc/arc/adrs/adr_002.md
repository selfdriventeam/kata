# [ADR_002](../../../README.md) Put Delivery component into Inventory subdomain

Date: 10/23

## Status

accepted

## Context

Initial component discovery contains generic subdomains such as: Order, Billing and Delivery.

## Decision

Merge Shipping & Delivery subdomain into Inventory subdomain. Reasons:
+ The business model of Farmacy Food does not use a traditional delivery model. The delivery actually means  re-stocking into/reclaming from the SmartFridge, which is part of the inventory management subdomain.
+ Inventory is a core subdomain of the system, how to restock (or in other words Delivery) is an essential part it. Therefore , restock/Delivery belongs to Inventory subdomain.

## Consequences

Reduction in number of top level components reduces complexity and information sharing. This reduces cognitive load and
makes development easier.
