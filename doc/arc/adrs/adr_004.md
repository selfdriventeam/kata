# [ADR_004](../../../README.md) Use a centralized notification for external communication

Date: 10/27

## Status

accepted

## Context

There was some confusion around the purpose of the notification component. Specifically, is this component
an event bus for **all** communication or is it a shared component for communicating externally.

## Decision

We decided to have a dedicated notification system responsible of sending external notification.
The reasons include:
* Multiple components (Customer, Order, Inventory, Promotions, etc) will be sending notifications
* Multiple types of recipients (Consumer, Delivery Person, Dietician, Chef, etc) will be targeted
* Centralize look and feel of notifications for brand management
* Centralize choice of notification method (email, sms, push, etc)
* Centralize interface with external providers

## Consequences

All other components will use the central notification component to send notifications to users.
