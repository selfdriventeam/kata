# [ADR_007](../../../README.md) Use external identity provider (FB/Google/Apple/Credit Cards) for authentication

Date: 10/27

## Status

accepted

## Context

Identifying and authenticating customer/admin is important step in the product workflow to prevent misuse and add personalization. It can either be achieved by building your own identity management/authentication or using a 3rd party solution (FB/Google/Apple/Credit Cards).

## Decision

We decided to integrate a 3rd party authentication/identity solution with our API gateway, supporting login via FB/Google/Apple/Credit Cards.

## Consequences

With this, the barrier to start using the product will be lower and we will be able to leeverage already existing accounts of the users. In addition, it makes the task of identity management and authentication much easier. However, we do recognize that this will limit users who don't have any of the 3rd party accounts and would need an additional option in the future.
