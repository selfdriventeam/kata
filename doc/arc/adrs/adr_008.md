Date: 10/27

## Status

accepted

## Context

One of the key features of the product is to provide personalized recommendations to the eaters for healthy food, it can either be achieved by having professional nutritionists review each eater needs one by one and providing personalized plans or a more scalable approach of using a Machine Learning system to generate personalized plans.

In either case, the eater's personal health/previous order information will be a key data point. The architecture needs to make sure that it doesn't allow eaters to be identified by their personal/health information and is compliant with various laws (HIPAA, etc.).

## Decision

PII (Personal Identifiable Information) of eaters should be anonymized before being used for personalized recommendations.

## Consequences

This approach allows us to fully utilize the eater data in providing useful and relevant personalized recommendations without compromising eater privacy. It will also help us maintain better compliance with various laws.
