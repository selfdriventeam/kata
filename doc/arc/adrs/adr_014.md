# [ADR_014](../../../README.md) Customer subdomain design decisions

Date: 10/31

## Status

accepted

## Context

This adr captures component design decisions in Customer subdomain.

## Decision

We follow the same design process as we used before, which is, identifying top level pieces first. ã€€

Among actor/action, event storming, and workflow approaches. We chose event storming approach. Reasons
+ There are limited number of actor within this subdomain
+ There are many events can be identified easily identified.

We first started with brain storming all the possible events could happen in this subdomain, and then write out the commands that trigger those events, and at last identify the data aggregates that these commands will be operating upon. Then it became clear that customer subdomain can be further divided into Profile, Order and Subscription.

## Consequences
This sub-component division did not reveal the workflow.
