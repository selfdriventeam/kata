Date: 10/31

## Status

accepted

## Context

This adr captures component design decisions in Order subdomain.

## Decision

We follow the same design process as we used before, which is, identifying top level pieces first. ã€€

Among actor/action, event storming, and workflow approaches. We chose workflow approach, because in this subdomain: data related to the order flow through the system, going through different stages of transformation: such as validation, pricing, evaluation.
