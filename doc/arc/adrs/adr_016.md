# [ADR_016](../../../README.md) Billing & Pricing domain design decision

Date: 11/01

## Status

accepted

## Context

Requirements mentioned "Accept coupons and promotional pricing" and "allow multiple vendors", these implies customizable pricing, we need to incorporate this into the design.

## Decision

We decide to have a core pricing component that takes care of regular pricing, and use dependency injection to allow customizable pricing model, such as coupons, regional promotions. For billing, we envision it to be a generic billing sub-component, contains regular workflows, we did not drill into it further.
