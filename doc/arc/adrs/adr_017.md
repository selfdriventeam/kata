# [ADR_017](../../../README.md) Use queue to update the inventory and external notification


Date: 10/29

## Status

accepted

## Context

We discussed what should be the communication method to the inventory and notification system. This ADR records the reasoning behind the decision.

## Decision

We have chosen message based approach. Pro and Con comparison can be found in [ADR_013](adr_013.md). Primarily because we do not think Inventory nor Notification system need to response to the incoming request, using message based system maximally decouples the system.

## Consequences
