# [ADR_019](../../../README.md) Inventory subdomain design decision

Date: 11/01

## Status

accepted

## Context

Inventory is a core part of FarmacyFood system, it is distributed in natural, accurate monitoring inventory level of all storage under different constraint is important.

## Decision

We envision the update to inventory is message based, this decouples the inventory system to different kinds of storage's.

For example:
+ SmartFridge : The scanning of checked out food would generate a message to update the inventory
+ Delivery Driver: When restocking the food, driver will scan the bar code of the food at the fridge, before putting it into the fridge. When purging the food, driver will scan the bar code also. In both case, message will be generated and sent to the inventory's message queue.


Monitoring sub component will periodically check the inventory level, and makes decision about restocking and send cooking instructions to the Chef. These out going message will be sent via external notification system.
